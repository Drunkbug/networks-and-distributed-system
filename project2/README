Language Used : Python

Initially to start project2 we used the starter code in python. 
Using that code, we made a simple bridge that generates a spanning tree 
by broadcasting and receiving signal from host. After receiving the data, 
we use the json to parse the message. Then, when the type
of the message is a bpdu, the bridge compares to see the source of the port. 
After it identifies the root port, it blocks that port and tranmits
the message to the other ports ports that are not blocked. When the bridge 
decides to change it's root, it will rebroadcast it's new bpdu to 
all its ports.
