CS 3700 - Networks and Distributed System Project-3 README

Language used: Python
For Project 3 we used the starter code given to us. We had to figure out how to test
the given code. 

We sent the packets with fields such as the sequence , data, checksum and eof. 
We defaulted eof to -1 for all packets except the last one and stored Checksum 
as a haslib. 

Initially we wrote our code using json and to improve the efficiency we changed to 
struct which was an easy decision since we had our code in python to start with. 
To handle corrupted packets, we used the checksum field and checked the packets to
see if they have been mangled and threw an error if it did. We also updated the RTT 
dynamically to make it more faster by updating the RTT based on the previous
and new RTT.

The challenging part of this project was modifying our code to adapt to the struct
library since our eof started to spout different checksums. However, we finnaly managed
to extract the correct checksum and fixed it. 

To test our protocol, we stimulated different sizes of data and checked most of our if 
statements to make sure it handles errors properly.
